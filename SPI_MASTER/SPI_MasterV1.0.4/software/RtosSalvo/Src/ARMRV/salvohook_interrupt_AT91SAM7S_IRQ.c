File illustrates user interrupt control functions 
for use with Salvo applications built with the
ARM RealView C compiler for a target in the Atmel AT91SAM7S 
family.

In this implementation, IRQ interrupts are controlled globally
and blindly, i.e. without regard to the interrupt control
bit's prior setting.
 
Without disabling the global interrupts during Salvo's 
critical sections, corruption will occur when OSTimer() 
is called from within an IRQ.

Dummy versions of OSDisable|Enable|Restore|SaveInts() 
are included in all Salvo libraries. If a Salvo 
application does not use interrupts, then the user
need not create any application-specific versions of
these functions.

Similarly, if a Salvo application uses only a particular
interrupt (e.g. the PITC to call OSTimer()), then interrupt
control with finer granularity can be used to enhance overall
system performance and eliminate interrupt latency in all
interrupt sources that do not call Salvo services. E.g. see
salvohook_interrupt_AT91SAM7S_PITC.c
