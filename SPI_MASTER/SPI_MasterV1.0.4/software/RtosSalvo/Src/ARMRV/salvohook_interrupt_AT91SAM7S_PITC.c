File illustrates user interrupt control functions 
for use with Salvo applications built with the
ARM RealView C compiler for a target in the Atmel AT91SAM7S 
family.

In this implementation, the interrupt enable bit for
Periodic Interval Timer is controlled to ensure that 
interrupts are disabled during critical sections. When
controlling interrupts in this manner, the only ISR
that calls any of Salvo's services should be the PITC
ISR. Normally, it will call OSTimer() at a periodic
rate, e.g. 10ms.
 
Without disabling the PIT interrupts during Salvo's 
critical sections, corruption will occur when OSTimer() 
is called from within the PIT ISR.

Dummy versions of OSDisable|Enable|Restore|SaveInts() 
are included in all Salvo libraries. If a Salvo 
application does not use interrupts, then the user
need not create any application-specific versions of
these functions.
