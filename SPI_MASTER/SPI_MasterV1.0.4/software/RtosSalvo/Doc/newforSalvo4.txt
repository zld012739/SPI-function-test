***** DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SALVO v3 and SALVO 4 ******

1) Different organization of project files, etc.

2) Context-switching labels no longer required for most compilers:

  Salvo v3:   OS_Delay(20, label);
  Salvo 4:    OS_Delay(20);

3) Interrupt control for critical sections is now implemented as
two user hooks (default/library: see docs):

  OSDisableHook();
  OSEnableHook();

See your compiler's Salvo reference  manual for a discussion of 
how to use these functions.

4) Idle hook now implemented as a user hook (default: dummy 
function):
 
  OSIdlingHook();

5) WDT clear/reset now implemented as a user hook (default/library: 
see docs):

  OSClrWDTHook();

6) All salvo source files are prefixed with "salvo". Salvo v3's
mem.c is now salvomem.c, etc. This only affects Salvo Pro
users.
