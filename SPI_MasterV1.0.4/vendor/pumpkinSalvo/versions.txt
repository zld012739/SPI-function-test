salvoportiararm.s79

  * Updated Salvo for IAR EWARM context switcher that forcibly aligns the stack on an 8-byte
      boundary, to ensure compatibility when 8-byte-long variables (e.g., doubles) are present.

salvo-lite|le|pro-arm-4.3.0-ex1.exe:

  * EXPERIMENTAL update including the GCC-ARM, ARM RealView & C-ARM context switchers from the
      original Salvo 4.0.0 release (2006 vintage). Source and Header files only, plus some
      documentation, for these compilers. No attempt has been made to validate these files 
      within the current 4.3.0 framework. Experienced Salvo users may be able to get these to
      compile and run, with modifications primarily relating to the preprocessor. No libraries.
  * No changes to the (working) IAR EWARM portions of this distribution. 
  * Also, added older, possible incompatible salvo-pro-arm-4.0.2.-rc1.exe to serve as a comparitive reference
      for users porting the GCC-ARM, ARM RealView & C-ARM context switchers to v4.3.0.

salvo-lite|le|pro-arm-4.3.0-ex0.exe:

  * First release of Salvo 4 for ARM that is consistent with the other
      releases (MSP430, AVR, PIC24/dsPIC, PIC32, S1C17).
  * For IAR EWARM v5 & v6
  * For ARM7TDMI, Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 targets. Other targets may also work.
  * Examples are not up-to-date.
  * Some documentation is not up-to-date.

salvo-lite|le|pro-arm-4.0.2-rc1.exe:

  * Fixes a problem when OSCOMBINE_EVENT_SERVICES is TRUE
      and OSENABLE_FAST_SIGNALING is TRUE.

***

salvo-lite|le|pro-arm-4.0.1-rc1.exe:

  * Fixes a problem involving union u3 and libraries.
  * Changes the calling convention, return codes and
      error checking for OStID() and OSeID(). These functions
      are now runtime capable, even in library builds.
  * Changes the function prototype for OSMakeStr().
  * Adds a functinal OSDestroyTask() that can destroy tasks
      in any state.
  * IAR: Fixes OS_Replace().

  Also, Compiler reference manual RM-IARARM.PDF is now available online.

***

salvo-lite|le|pro-arm-4.0.0-rc50.exe supports the following
tools and targets:

  ARM RealView Tools:			ARM7TDMI & Cortex-M3
  GCC-ARM:				Cortex-M3
  IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM:	ARM7TDMI

-rc50 is the first release to support big-endian targets, 
with the IAR compiler. 

***

salvo-lite|le|pro-arm-4.0.0-rc34.exe adds support for
all ARM7TDMI cores, in both Thumb and ARM mode. It includes 
an example for the Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK evalutation board.
Until a Getting Started Guide is issued for Salvo on ARM7,
please use the Getting Started Guides for Salvo on the Stellaris
as a guide for configuring your own projects. This installer
fully supports Stellaris as well.
